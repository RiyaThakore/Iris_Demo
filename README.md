# Models

This repository contains the example Diabetes Prediction model code for ModelOps. We provide a number of demo projects and associated repositories. The goal of these examples is to provide a simple reference implementation for users and not to provide a detailed data science example for each use case. 

Please refer to the [Official Documentation](https://docs.teradata.com/r/Teradata-VantageTM-ModelOps-User-Guide/June-2022) for more information.
